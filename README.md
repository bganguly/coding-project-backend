# README for branch_03_backend #

This project requires us to develop a website template viewer. See details in [README.md in master branch](https://github.com/bganguly/siemens-coding-project/tree/master#readme) 

This specific branch provides a localhost:3001 express app to serve up images and template.json files. The code was originally bootstapped via the express-generator scaffolding.

To run:
```
// git clone and checkout the branch, thereafter
rm -rf package-lock.json ; rm -rf node-modules/ ; npm i
npm start
```
